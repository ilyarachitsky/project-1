                    Born in Germany (3 January 1969) he still polarises opinion, and there’s no question that he over-stepped the mark more often than was necessary. To put it mildly. But Michael Schumacher remains an all-time great and not just because he won seven world
                    championships, 91 races and smashed every record there was to smash. Or that he possessed the Senna-like ability to drive his car right on the limit, while being physically fit and intelligent enough to keep a good chunk of his mental
                    firepower in reserve to manage tricky pit-wall calls. He was also a fascinating and complex character, more complex than you might think. And more human, too.</p>

                <p>Born in Scotland (4 March 1936 – 7 April 1968) he showed us that not all of the world’s great sporting stars are as extrovert as they might appear – or as we might want them to be. Jim Clark was one of the most unassuming men ever to sit
                    in an F1 cockpit, but also arguably the most singularly gifted driver of all time. The son of a Borders sheep farmer whose route to F1 was facilitated by Lotus and its founder Colin Chapman, he won two world championships, in 1963
                    and 1965, but was equally dazzling in sports cars, touring cars, rally, NASCAR, F2 and also managed to win the 1965 Indianapolis 500, driving the first mid-engined car to do so, and leading 190 of the 200 laps (all of this while driving
                    in F1).

                <p>Born in Brazil (21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was the driver who was prepared to go further in pursuit of victory than anyone before him, who elevated the art of driving a Formula One car to a level that was almost spiritual, and who did
                    so not just with a sublime skill but also weapons-grade charisma. A racing driver, then, but so, so much more. And one whose legend has only grown since his passing during the San Marino GP in 1994.

                <p>Born in Great Britan (7 January 1985) he's still winning races and breaking records, so it may seem a little premature to be venerating Lewis. On the other hand… he’s still winning races and breaking records. “I think he’s more complete
                    than Michael,” Mark Webber recently observed. “I think he went about those results in a technically cleaner executed way, just by the way of wheel-to-wheel combat and no real trickery in his contact with the other drivers.” There are
                    too many great drives to choose from, but the prodigious talent that produced such spectacular performances in the early part of his F1 career is now tempered by huge experience. Which means that he may not yet have even reached his
                    peak…

                <p> Born in Argentina (24 June 1911 – 17 July 1995) he won in the 1950s, not an era renowned for safety. He did it for four different teams – Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati – driving some of the most genuinely iconic racing
                    cars in the history of the sport, and finished second twice. And while those were different times and far fewer races were run, Fangio’s hit rate is still extraordinary. By all accounts a humble and warm-hearted gentleman, Fangio nevertheless
                    made sure he was always in the right car at the right time. This upset Enzo Ferrari, who prized total fealty to his team above all, but established a motor racing truism that still holds today. Then again, perhaps Fangio was the one
                    driver who was actually bigger than Ferrari.
