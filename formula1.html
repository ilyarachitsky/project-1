            <h1>Michael Schumacher</h1>
            <img src="assets/10684142-3x2-xlarge.jpg" alt="Michael Schumacher">
            <p>Michael Schumacher (Born 3 January 1969) is a retired German racing driver who competed in Formula One for Jordan Grand Prix, Benetton, Ferrari (where he spent most of his career), and Mercedes. Schumacher is widely regarded as one of the
                greatest Formula One drivers ever, and is regarded by some journalists, experts and fellow drivers as the greatest of all time. His haul of <b>7 World DriversChampionship titles</b> is an all-time record (tied with Lewis Hamilton), while
                he holds the records for the
                <b>most fastest laps (77)</b> and jointly the <b>most races won in a single season (13)</b>. He was also noted throughout his career for pushing his car to the very limit for sustained periods and a pioneering fitness regimen.In 1991,
                his Mercedes-funded race debut for the Jordan Formula One team resulted in Schumacher being signed by Benetton for the rest of that season. He finished third in 1992 and fourth in 1993, before becoming the first German World Drivers '
                Champion in 1994 by one point over Damon Hill, albeit in controversial circumstances. In 1996 Schumacher moved to Ferrari, who had last won the Drivers Championship in 1979, and helped them transform into the most successful team in Formula
                One history. Schumacher won five consecutive drivers titles from 2000 to 2004, <b>including an unprecedented sixth and seventh title.</b> In 2002, Schumacher won the title with a record six races remaining and finished on the podium in
                every race. In 2004, Schumacher won 12 out of the first 13 races, and went on to win a record 13 times as he won his final title. Schumacher retired from Formula One in 2006, after finishing runner-up to Renault 's Fernando Alonso. Schumacher
                returned to Formula One in 2010 with Mercedes. He produced the fastest qualifying time at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix, and achieved his only podium on his return at the 2012 European Grand Prix, where he finished third. In October 2012
                Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time at the end of the season. </p>

            <h1>Jim Clark</h1>
            <img src="assets/Jim_Clark_1965.jpg" alt="Jim Clark">
            <p>Clark achieved <b>33 pole positions and won 25 races from his 72 Grands Prix</b> starts in championship races. He is remembered for his ability to drive and win in all types of cars and series, including a Lotus-Cortina, with which he won
                the 1964 British Touring Car Championship; IndyCar; Rallying, where he took part in the 1966 RAC Rally of Great Britain in a Lotus Cortina; and sports cars. He <b>competed in the Le Mans 24 Hour</b> race in 1959, 1960 and 1961, finishing
                second in class in 1959 driving a Lotus Elite, and finishing third overall in 1960, driving an Aston Martin DBR1. <b>He took part in a NASCAR event</b>, driving a 7-litre Holman Moody Ford at the American 500 at the banked speedway at
                Rockingham on 29 October 1967.He was also able to master difficult Lotus sportscar prototypes such as the Lotus 30 and 40. <b>Clark had an ability to adapt to whichever car he was driving. Whilst other drivers would struggle to find a
                good car setup</b>, Clark would usually set competitive lap times with whatever setup was provided and ask for the car to be left as it was. He still maintains the <b>record for most Grand Slams (Pole, win, fastest lap, and led every lap) doing an impressive 8</b>,
                ahead of racers like Hamilton (6) and Schumacher (5). Sir Jackie Stewart said of what made Clark such a good driver "He was so smooth, he was so clean, he drove with such finesse. He never bullied a racing car, he sort of caressed it into
                doing the things he wanted it to do. When Clark died, fellow driver Chris Amon said, "If it could happen to him, what chance do the rest of us have? I think we all felt that. It seemed like we'd lost our leader".Clark is buried in the
                village of Chirnside in Berwickshire. A memorial stone can be found at the Hockenheimring circuit, moved from the site of his crash to a location closer to the current track, and a life-size statue of him in racing overalls stands by the
                bridge over a small stream in the village of his birth, Kilmany in Fife. A small museum, which is known as The Jim Clark Room, can be found in Duns.</p>

            <p> Ayrton Senna da Silva (21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian racing driver who <b>won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in 1988, 1990 and 1991</b>, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time,
                and by some as the greatest ever. He died in an accident leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix driving for Williams Racing. Senna has often been voted as the best and most influential Formula One driver of all time in various motorsport
                polls. He was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap, and from 1989 until 2006 he held the record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese
                Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. He holds a record six victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, and is the fifth-most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly
                during his turbulent rivalry with Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.<b>He elevated the art of driving a Formula One car to a level that was almost spiritual, and who did so not just with a sublime skill but also weapons-grade charisma.</b>

            <img src="assets/Hamilton.jpg" alt="Lewis Hamilton">
            <p> Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver currently competing in Formula One for Mercedes, having previously driven for McLaren. Hamilton has won a <b>seven World Drivers Championship titles</b> (tied with
                Michael Schumacher), while he holds the outright records for the <b> wins (95), pole positions (98), podium finishes (164), points finishes (228), career points (3763) and points in a season (413).</b> Hamilton is regarded as one of the
                greatest Formula One drivers in history, with some journalists, experts and fellow drivers describing him as the greatest of all time. Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton enjoyed a successful ascent up the racing ladder
                and was signed to the McLaren young driver programme in 1998. This later resulted in a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007, making Hamilton the first and only black driver to race in the sport, as of 2020. Hamilton won his third and
                fourth titles in a row in 2019 and 2020, respectively, equalling Schumacher 's record of seven drivers' titles. Listed in the 2020 issue of Time as <b>one of the 100 most influential people globally</b>, Hamilton has been credited with
                furthering Formula One 's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism and his exploits in music and fashion. A target of racist abuse
                throughout his career, Hamilton has been outspoken in his criticism of racial politics in Formula One as well as advocating for greater diversity in the sport. </p>

            <img src="assets/fangio1958e.jpg" alt="Juan Manuel Fangio">
            <p>Juan Manuel Fangio (24 June 1911 – 17 July 1995), nicknamed El Chueco or El Maestro, was an Argentine racing car driver. <b>He dominated the first decade of Formula One racing, winning the World Drivers Championship five times.</b> From childhood,
                he abandoned his studies to pursue auto mechanics. In 1938, he debuted in Turismo Carretera, competing in a Ford V8. In 1940, he competed with Chevrolet, winning the Grand Prix International Championship and devoted his time to the Argentine
                Turismo Carretera becoming its champion, a title he successfully defended a year later. Fangio then competed in Europe between 1947 and 1949, where he achieved further success. <b>He won the World Championship of Drivers five times—a
                        record which stood for 46 years until beaten by Michael Schumacher—with four different teams (Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati), a feat that has not been repeated</b>. He is regarded by many as one of the greatest
                F1 drivers in history, and considered by some to be the greatest of all time. He holds the <b>highest winning percentage in Formula One – 46.15% – winning 24 of 52 Formula One races</b> he entered. Fangio is the only Argentine driver to
                have won the Argentine Grand Prix, which he won four times in his career, more than any other driver. After retirement, Fangio presided as the honorary president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina from 1987, a year after the inauguration of his
                museum, until his death in 1995. On the centenary of his birth in 2011, Fangio was remembered around the world and various activities were held in his honor.</p>
