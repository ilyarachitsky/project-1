                    Diego Armando Maradona 30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020 was an Argentine professional football player and manager. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of
                    the 20th Century award. Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players. His presence
                    and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition.
