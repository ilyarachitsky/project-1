                    Sugar Ray Robinson (born Walker Smith Jr.; May 3, 1921 – April 12, 1989) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1940 to 1965. 
                    He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. He is widely regarded as the greatest boxer of all time.
                    He turned professional in 1940 at the age of 19 and by 1951 had a professional record of 128–1–2 with 84 knockouts.
                    From 1943 to 1951 Robinson went on a 91-fight unbeaten streak, the third-longest in professional boxing history.
                    Robinson held the world welterweight title from 1946 to 1951, and won the world middleweight title in the latter year. 
                    He retired in 1952, only to come back two-and-a-half years later and regain the middleweight title in 1955. 
                    He then became the first boxer in history to win a divisional world championship five times.
                    Ali had a career record of 56 wins, five losses and 37 knockouts before his retirement from boxing in 1981 at the age of 39.

                    Ali was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. His birth name was Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. 
                    Muhammad Ali was a boxer, philanthropist and social activist who is universally regarded as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century. 
                    Ali became an Olympic gold medalist in 1960 and the world heavyweight boxing champion in 1964. 
                    Following his suspension for refusing military service, Ali reclaimed the heavyweight title two more times during the 1970s, winning famed bouts against Joe Frazier and George Foreman along the way. 
                    Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, Ali devoted much of his time to philanthropy, earning the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005.

                    Michael Gerard Tyson was born on June 30, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York. 
                    He became the youngest heavyweight boxing champion of the world in 1986, at age 20. 
                    He lost the title in 1990 and later served three years in prison for rape charges. 
                    He subsequently earned further notoriety by biting Evander Holyfield's ear during a rematch in 1997. 
                    Tyson has gone on to appear in several films and a Broadway show on his life, become a best-selling author and launch a successful cannabis business.

                    American boxer Floyd Mayweather was born on February 24, 1977, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
                    He won three national Golden Gloves and an Olympic bronze medal before turning professional in 1996. 
                    Mayweather claimed his first championship as a super featherweight in 1998, later accumulating titles in four other weight classes while retaining an undefeated record.
                    Mayweather turned professional on October 11, 1996. As a pro, Mayweather continued to win at an astonishing rate. 
                    With his father serving as both manager and trainer after his release from prison, the talented boxer won several easy bouts. 
                    In 1998, he defeated Genaro Hernandez to capture his first world title, the WBC super featherweight championship.
