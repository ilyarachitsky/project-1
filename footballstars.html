            <p>Whoa whoa whoa...all you Pelè and Maradona devotees, put down the axes and pitchforks and listen to me. The reasoning behind my choice for numero uno doesn't come down to purely technical abilities or international exploits: you can still safely say that both Pelè and Maradona were better (but just barely) individual players, but  neither bequeathed anything as as revolutionary or enduring as Cruyff's vision of "Total Football":  a style of play characterized by "tiki-taka" passing, commanding possession and the interchangeability of the outfield players now particularly in evidence at Barcelona. </p>

            <p> Ayrton Senna da Silva (21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian racing driver who <b>won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in 1988, 1990 and 1991</b>, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time,
                and by some as the greatest ever. He died in an accident leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix driving for Williams Racing. Senna has often been voted as the best and most influential Formula One driver of all time in various motorsport
                polls. He was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap, and from 1989 until 2006 he held the record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese
                Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. He holds a record six victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, and is the fifth-most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly
                during his turbulent rivalry with Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.

            <p> Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver currently competing in Formula One for Mercedes, having previously driven for McLaren. Hamilton has won a <b>seven World Drivers Championship titles</b> (tied with
                Michael Schumacher), while he holds the outright records for the <b> wins (95), pole positions (98), podium finishes (164), points finishes (228), career points (3763) and points in a season (413).</b> Hamilton is regarded as one of the
                greatest Formula One drivers in history, with some journalists, experts and fellow drivers describing him as the greatest of all time. Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton enjoyed a successful ascent up the racing ladder
                and was signed to the McLaren young driver programme in 1998. This later resulted in a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007, making Hamilton the first and only black driver to race in the sport, as of 2020. Hamilton won his third and
                fourth titles in a row in 2019 and 2020, respectively, equalling Schumacher 's record of seven drivers' titles. Listed in the 2020 issue of Time as <b>one of the 100 most influential people globally</b>, Hamilton has been credited with
                furthering Formula One 's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism and his exploits in music and fashion. A target of racist abuse
                throughout his career, Hamilton has been outspoken in his criticism of racial politics in Formula One as well as advocating for greater diversity in the sport. </p>

            <img src="assets/fangio1958e.jpg" alt="Juan Manuel Fangio">
            <p>Juan Manuel Fangio (24 June 1911 – 17 July 1995), nicknamed El Chueco or El Maestro, was an Argentine racing car driver. <b>He dominated the first decade of Formula One racing, winning the World Drivers Championship five times.</b> From childhood,
                he abandoned his studies to pursue auto mechanics. In 1938, he debuted in Turismo Carretera, competing in a Ford V8. In 1940, he competed with Chevrolet, winning the Grand Prix International Championship and devoted his time to the Argentine
                Turismo Carretera becoming its champion, a title he successfully defended a year later. Fangio then competed in Europe between 1947 and 1949, where he achieved further success. <b>He won the World Championship of Drivers five times—a
                        record which stood for 46 years until beaten by Michael Schumacher—with four different teams (Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati), a feat that has not been repeated</b>. He is regarded by many as one of the greatest
                F1 drivers in history, and considered by some to be the greatest of all time. He holds the <b>highest winning percentage in Formula One – 46.15% – winning 24 of 52 Formula One races</b> he entered. Fangio is the only Argentine driver to
                have won the Argentine Grand Prix, which he won four times in his career, more than any other driver. After retirement, Fangio presided as the honorary president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina from 1987, a year after the inauguration of his
                museum, until his death in 1995. On the centenary of his birth in 2011, Fangio was remembered around the world and various activities were held in his honor.</p>
